next up:
Week 3:
Next week, in Week 3, we will hopefully have our teams and projects decided and begin work on them.

It would probably be a good idea to start by agreeing on scheduling and communication expectations.
Ideally, we would find a good time for the team to meet, possibly once or twice per week in a group audio- or video-call.

We would also agree on some software or platforms to use to facilitate that communication, such as
  - Slack, Teams, Discord, email, or others
and another solution to use for file sharing. I expect we will use Github for the repository,
but some people may expect to use other services like
  - Google Docs, Google Drive, OneDrive, email, or others
for brainstorming and temporary working files.

Week 2:
In Week 2, I am working on the react.js tutorial. I will update with more details on my progress afterwards.

Week 1:
In Week 1, I created the repository, the README.md, and the Individual Process Document.txt.
